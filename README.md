This is an implementation of code developed for the paper "Filtration Simplification for Persistent Homology via Edge Contraction" by Dey and Slechta and presented at (DGCI 2019)[https://dgci2019.sciencesconf.org/]. A preprint for the paper can be found (here)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04388] and the DGCI version can be found (here)[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14085-4_8].

The code is designed for simplifying real valued simplicial complexes via edge contraction while bounding the perturbation in persistence. At present, the code is only designed for 2-complexes, and permits extensive user customization. 

An example of the code simplifying a terrain, and the small perturbation in the corresponding persistence diagrams, can be seen below.

Improvements are ongoing.
